# guava-disease-image-classification


I fine tuned squeezenet to classified guava diseas using [(Amin, Md Al; Mahmud, Md Iqbal; Rahman, Asadullah Bin; Parvin, Mst Aktarina; Mamun, Md Abdulla Al (2024), “Guava Fruit Disease Dataset”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/bkdkc4n835.1)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asadullahgalib/guava-disease-dataset) dataset. Currently the model achieved 100% accuracy and 0.0029 loss. 

I'm still investigating wether the accuracy is valid or i'm having some overfitting or other issues. After i find the answer i will deploy the model to a website. You can view my model trained right [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dJqRAeWz9msibmX1jKCFNjNozQHt32-u?usp=sharing).
